Arucas is an Interpreted Language using Java, with similar syntax to Java.

A huge thank you to [HardCoded](https://github.com/Kariaro) for helping immensely with this project

[Here](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code) is the reference 
code for this project and uses much of the same basic logic, although a 
large amount of code has been rewritten by myself to function with Java, 
as the reference code was written in python.

This was made largely for a project for a Minecraft mod that can be found [here](https://github.com/senseiwells/EssentialClient)
