# Arucas

Arucas is an Interpreted Language using Java, with similar syntax to Java.

[Here](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code) is the reference 
code for this project and uses much of the same basic logic, although a 
large amount of code has been rewritten by myself to function with Java, 
as the reference code was written in python.
