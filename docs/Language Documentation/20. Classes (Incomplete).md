## Classes

Classes in Arucas allow for abstraction, they provide a way to encapsulate values into another value, and classes let you define certain behaviour with the value such as interactions with operators and the methods that the value has.

### Syntax

The class syntax is very simple and similar to many other languages, we use the `class` keyword to declare a class definition followed by the name of the class and then a series of class statements which we will cover further on in this section.
```kotlin
// Classes follow Pascal Naming
class ExampleClass {
}
```

### Constructors

Constructors are essentially functions that are run when the class is instantiated. These are often used to set fields and often take parameters. By default, if no constructor is declared then a synthetic constructor is created: you will be able to construct the class without any parameters. However, if any constructors are defined this synthetic constructor will not be available.

To define a constructor in a class, we use the class name followed by brackets which can contain parameters and then followed by a statement which is run when the class is instantiated.
```kotlin
class ExampleClass {
    // Constructor
    ExampleClass() {
    }
}
```
