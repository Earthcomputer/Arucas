## Input

We can take input from the console, by using another simple function called `input`, unlike print this function can only have one parameter, this is the prompt that the user is displayed with for their input:
```kotlin
input("What is your name? ");
```
The user will then be able to type in the console and once they press enter their input will be submitted.

So now that we've got the function to prompt the user with input we need to store it, and we can do this by using a variable, like before how we stored literals inside a variable we can store what we call the return value of the function in a variable too:
```kotlin
userInput = input("What is your name? ");
```
Now that we have the user input stored in a variable, we can use it inside our code:
```kotlin
userInput = input("What is your name? ");
// If the user inputted "mike"
print("Your name is: ", userInput, "\n");
// This should print Your name is: mike\n
```
