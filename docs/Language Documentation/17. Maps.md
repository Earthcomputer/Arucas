## Maps

Maps like lists are a form of collection, maps can be seen as similar to lists, but instead of using indexes to access a value maps allow you to define a specific key value to access certain values. Maps have a literal, and by default these will be ordered based on the order they are inputted. Maps also have no fixed size.

### Simple Maps

Maps have a literal: `{}` which can be used to create maps. In the literal, you must declare a key and a value which are separated by a colon:
```kotlin
map = {"key": "value"};

// We can also declare an empty map
map = {};
```
Any types can be used for keys or values, for custom classes you need to ensure they have an appropriate hashing function, however we will cover this later in the classes section.

To define multiple key value pairs we just separate them with a comma, this is usually done over multiple lines:
```kotlin
map = {
    "key": "value",
    "otherKey": "value",
    "foo": "bar"
};
```

Similarly to Lists we can get the length of the map by using `len`, this returns the number of key value pairs:
```kotlin
len({"a": "A", "b": "B"}); // -> 2

len({}); // -> 0
```

### Using Maps

Maps are very similar to lists except using specific keys to access and assign values, here are some examples:
```kotlin
map = {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "three": 3
};

// get method allows us to get a value using a key
print(map.get("one")); // -> 1
// Similarly to lists maps also allow the short hand by

// using the bracket operator
print(map["two"]); // -> 2

// put method allows us to add a key value pair
// this will replace any previous value with the given key
map.put("four", 4); // map = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}

// Here is an example of it replacing an existing key
map.put("four", 0); // map = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 0}

// Similar to list we can also set keys by using the bracket operator
map["four"] = 4; // map = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}

// remove method removes a key and value from the map
map.remove("one"); // map = {"two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
```

Some other useful methods of the map are those that get all the keys and values:
```kotlin
map = {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "three": 3
};

// These methods return lists containing keys and values
keys = map.getKeys(); // keys = ["one", "two", "three"]
values = map.getValues(); // values = [1, 2, 3]
```

Another useful thing to note is that when using the `foreach` loop maps will loop over their keys, inside the loop you can the use it to access the value:
```kotlin
map = {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "three": 3
};

foreach (key : map) {
    value = map[key];
    // Do something
}
```

### Sets

Sets are another form of collection. A set is basically just a map that doesn't have values, this allows for a list-like collection, however you cannot access the values using an index and cannot have duplicate values in the set. Sets have the benefit that they are faster to search than lists, an example of this will be shown in the section.

Unlike Maps and Lists, Sets do not have a literal form and so you will need to use the `Set` class to create a set, we do this by using the `of` method that can take an arbitrary amount of parameters:
```kotlin
// Empty set
Set.of();

Set.of(1, 2, 3); // -> <1, 2, 3>
```

As previously mentioned sets have the benefit of a fast searching algorithm, here is an example:
```kotlin
validNames = Set.of("Foo", "Bar", "Baz");

name = "Some Example Name";

// contains method is much faster than list
if (validNames.contains(name)) {
    print("You are valid");
}
```
