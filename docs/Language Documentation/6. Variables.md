## Variables

A key part of programming is being able to manipulate data, and we do this by using variables, you can think of a variable like a container. To define a variable we need to give it a name and then a value, and we can assign the variable with the value by using the assignment operator, `=`:
```kotlin
exampleVariable = "Example string";
```
Assigning a variable is like putting something inside the container.

Variable names can only include letters and underscores, by convention variable names should follow camel casing, this is where you capitalize all the words bar the first then squash them together.

Once you have defined a variable, you can reassign the variable by again using the assignment operator.
```kotlin
exampleVariable = "Example string";
exampleVariable = "Overwritten!";
// exampleVariable now stores the value: "Overwritten"
```
Variables can store any type of value, we will come onto other types of values, for example numbers or booleans.

Now once you have stored a value in a variable you can use it by referencing the name of the variable, referring back to the previous analogy, this is like peeking into the container to see what is inside.
```kotlin
exampleVariable = "Example string";
print(exampleVariable);
// We would get an output of: Example string
```
