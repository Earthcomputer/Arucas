## Installation

This installation guide is for those who want to just run vanilla Arucas not bundled in with another application. If you are running Arucas inside another application you can just skip this part.

First you need to install the latest version of Arucas, you can download the jar file from [here](https://github.com/senseiwells/Arucas/releases). 
After downloading the jar make sure you have Java 16 or above installed as Arucas relies on this, you can then run the jar using the command line, replacing `<version>` with the appropriate version:
```
java -jar Arucas-<version>.jar -noformat
```
Now you will be running the Arucas Interpreter, here you can type any Arucas code and it will be run, if you want to exit the interpreter you can simply type:
```
exit
```
To run a file with Arucas code from the command line you can use the Built-in function:
```kotlin
run("path/of/arucas/file.arucas");
```
