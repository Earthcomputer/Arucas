## Switch Statements

Switch statements allow you to match values with an input, switch statements are faster when comparing literals (String, Number, Boolean, Null) as they can be evaluated at compile time. Switch statements have cases and will match the input to a case, which will then run a scope accordingly. Switch statements cannot have duplicate literals, but can have expressions that are evaluated at run time (like functions):
```kotlin
name = input("Name?");
switch (name) {
    case "Alex" -> {
        // Alex
    }
    case "James" -> {
        // Alex
    }
    case "Xavier" -> {
        // Xavier
    }
    case "Jenny" -> {
        // Jenny
    }
}

switch (name) {
    case input("Name again?") -> {
        // name == input("Name again?")
    }
}
```

Switch statements also have the ability to have multiple values for each case, as well as having a default case which will be run if the input matches none of the cases.
```kotlin
name = input("Name?");
switch(name) {
    case "Alex", "Steve" -> {
        // name == "Alex" || name == "Steve"
    }
    case null -> {
        // name == null
    }
    default -> {
        // Name was not Alex or Steve and was not null
    }
}
```
