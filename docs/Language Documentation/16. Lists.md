## Lists

Lists are a form of collection, they are the key data structure in the language, they allow you to store multiple values inside of one value, lists in Arucas are dynamic meaning that they do not have a fixed size you are also able to put any type of value in a list. Lists are an ordered data structure, meaning their order stays consistent with how you input values into the list.

### Simple Lists

Lists are very simple to use, as mentioned earlier in the documentation they can be declared with the List literal `[]`:
```kotlin
// Creating an empty list
list = [];
```

You are also able to put values inside the square brackets to declare a list with items in them.
```kotlin
// List with values 1, 2, "string"
list = [1, 2, "string"];
```

We can get the number of values inside a list by using a built-in function: `len`:
```kotlin
print(len([true, false, null])); // -> 3

print(len([])); // -> 0
```

### Using Lists

An important concept is understanding indexes of lists, each value as an index in a list with the first value in the list having an index of 0 and then incrementing by one until the last value. We can then use this to access values in the list.
```kotlin
list = ["first", "second", "third"];

// Index 0 corralates to the first index
print(list.get(0)); // -> "first"

// A short hand for accessing lists was introduced in 1.2.0
// We can use the [] operator to access an index in the list
print(list[1]); // -> "second"
```
Something to note is that if an index is provided that is outside the bounds of the list, then an error will be thrown.

To manipulate the contents of the list, we can take a look at the available methods:
```kotlin
list = [1, 2, 3];

// append method adds a value **to the end** of the list
list.append(4);

// insert method adds a value at a specific index in the list
list.insert(0, 0); // list = [0, 1, 2, 3]

// remove methods removes a value at a specific index
list.remove(3); // list = [0, 1, 2]

// set method sets the value at a specific index
list.set("zero", 0); // list = ["zero", 1, 2]

// A short hand for assigning indexes of lists was introduced in 1.2.0
// We can again use the [] operator to assign an index in the list
list[1] = "one"; // list = ["zero", "one", 2]
```

### List Unpacking

Lists provide special functionality in Arucas as they provide the ability to unpack them. This means you are able to extract all the variables in the list into variables. Here is an example:
```kotlin
// position with list having x, y, and z coordinates
position = [100, 50, -900];

// If we wanted to extract those we could do this:
x = position.get(0);
y = position.get(1);
z = position.get(2);

// Or we can use a shorthand: list unpacking
x, y, z = position; // x = 100, y = 50, z = -900

// To be able to do this the number of variables
// you are assigning must be equal to the length
// of the list, otherwise it will throw an error
```

Changing the values in the variables will not change the values in the list:
```kotlin
position = [100, 50, 200];
print(position); // -> [100, 50, 200]

x, y, z = position; // x = 100, y = 50, z = 200

x = 10;
// We now set x to 10 but this does not change
// the value in the list that x was assigned first

print(position); // -> [100, 50, 200]
```
