## Comments

Let's start by introducing comments, comments don't do anything in terms of running the code, but instead they allow you to describe what is happening in the code, when the code is run all comments are completely ignored.

There are two types of comments, single line and multiline. A single line comment can be written by typing `//` followed by your text, and a multi line comment consists of `/*` followed by your line(s) of text and then closed with `*/`:
```
// This is a single line comment
/*
 This is a multi line comment
 Very cool!
 */
```
An important thing to note about single line comments is that text will only be ignored after the `//`, anything on the left of the comment will still run as code.
