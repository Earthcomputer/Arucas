## Output

Now we know how to create a string, we can output it to the console. We can do this by using a function, we will cover functions in more detail later, but for now we can just use it and accept that it works. The main function that you will use to output is called `print`, and to call the function we follow the name up with a pair of brackets:
```kotlin
print();
```
This won't actually print anything, since we haven't told it what to print. We can provide this information by adding arguments inside our brackets:
```kotlin
// Having 1 parameter in the print function causes 
// it to automatically add a new line after it
print("Hello World!");
// This would print: Hello World\n
```
The `print` function also has the capability of concatenating (joining) strings together
```kotlin
print("Hello", "World");
// This would print: Hello World
```
