## Development Environment

We recommend the use of the [Arucas Plugin](https://github.com/Kariaro/ArucasHighlighter/tree/main) designed for IntelliJ by [HardCoded](https://github.com/Kariaro), this highlights your code informing you of errors in your code, and adding nice colours :).

Alternatively, if you do not wish to use IntelliJ another option is to use VSCode and set the language to `Java`, and disable validation for error highlighting. You can also configure VSCode to automatically recognize `.arucas` files as Java. 

So now that you are able to run Arucas files, what do we put inside? If you have not already, you should take a look at the [Language Syntax]() page briefly, but we will cover everything in detail here.
